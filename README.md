# Procedural mesh examples for Unreal 4

## CODE HAS MOVED
Instead of keeping this example project as a git repo + submodule I decided to merge them into a single repo (as any sane person would do).  This caused quite a lot of confusion for people not familiar with submodules.

Please see the main project here, which now contains all the code that was here.. and upgraded to UE 4.22 as well!
